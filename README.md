PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS:

Seas The Throne is an open world bullet-hell where the player must dash into the opponent's bullets to restore ammo. It was created as part of the CS 3152 Intro to Game Development course at Cornell University. It was made privately in a Cornell repository, but can be viewed here: https://gdiac.cs.cornell.edu/gdiac/showcase/gallery/seasthethrone/

Lunar Looter is a multi-level stealth game where you can only see where your flashlight points. Play as an alien explorer who must weave through enemies and reconstruct their spacecraft. Download the .zip file and open the .exe to play (Windows only)!
