## Verification questions

1. How many coins does your McDiver collect when running with a seed of
   `-4004310660161599891`?

   Answer: 395

## Reflection questions

1. Describe your "scram" strategy at a high level.  How does McDiver decide
   which coin to collect next, and how does he ensure he always escapes in time?
   Also describe how you came up with this strategy and why you settled on it.

   Answer: Our scram strategy is to place all the nodes in the map into a priority queue
   ordered by the best coin to distance (from the current location of McDiver) ratio.
   We calculate if McDiver is able to go to the best node (first in priority queue) and leave
   within stepsToGo, move to the tile, then recreate the priority queue with the new
   location of McDiver. If McDiver is not able to get to the tile, he goes to the exit.

2. Are you aware of any areas where your submission is not working as intended?
   If so, describe the issue and what you did to try to diagnose it.  Otherwise,
   describe how you verified that your submission fulfilled its requirements.

   Answer: No. We ran the -n 30 -s 10 command and also ran several -n 30 tests to ensure
   a consistent score. We also tested with all the special map seeds.

3. Did you implement your own priority queue, or add other new classes to the
   project?  If so, describe them here so your grader is aware of their
   existence.

   Answer: We used the Java PriorityQueue for scram.
